Beer Pong Game
==============

I plan to create an OpenGL program that simulates a basic game of beer pong.
At the most basic level, the user acts as a player who tries to shoot a ball
into one of 10 cups organized like bowling pins as such:

-----------
| O O O O |
|  O O O  |
|   O O   |
|    O    |
|         | 
|         | 
|         | 
|         | 
|         | 
|         | 
-----------
   player

The inspiration for the game is that it will incorporate most of the concepts
we will have learned in the course into a simple-to-play game which would be
fun for the user. Furthermore, the project will allow for iterative
improvement as I realize exactly how feasible my ideas are.

There are only three base objects I will need to create: the table, the board,
and the cups. I can create all of these manually (the ball is already 
implemented from previous assignments). Furthermore, I can add textures
to the cups to make them look "bumpy" (like the classic Red Solo Cup(TM)) and
to the table (e.g., a wooden texture). Lighting should be straightforward and
useful to the user. The scene will obviously boast a perspective projection as
this is realistically how the game is played. 

For now, I'm thinking that the user has a fixed number of "lives" with which
they can try to make the ball into a cup. As long as they keep making the shots,
their lives will not go down. The user will click on the screen to shoot the
ball (unless I come up with a better solution for shooting).

I believe this project should be challenging enough as a grad student. In 
particular, I will need to get the physics to work correctly which I'm not
sure will be addressed in the course. I will need to implement some collision 
detection to determine if the ball actually enters the cup instead of just
hitting the cup's rim.

As for "stretch goals", there are several I have considered. I can create a 
"party scene" in the background which might liven up the feel. I can add the
ability to bounce off the table for a trick shot. I can allow the user to move
left and right to get a new angle for their shot. Perhaps I can prompt the user
to choose a "difficulty" which would alter how many lives they have. I can 
also try to make as legitimate of a gaming UI as possible (with the lives and
other stats displayed on the side, etc.)
